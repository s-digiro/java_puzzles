Puzzle Solvers

This repo includes two programs designed to solve two puzzles.

The first is the eight queens puzzle. The goal is to place eight queens on a
chessboard such that none can take out the other. This program solves the puzzle
recursively.

The second is the tower of hanoi puzzle. The user is first asked to specify how
many disks should be used in the puzzle, and the program then outputs a list of
moves to solve the puzzle. The objective of the puzzle is to, starting with
three plates and a tower of n disks of different sizes on the leftmost plate,
move the entire tower to rightmost plate without putting any larger disks atop
any smaller disks.
